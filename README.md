## âœ¨Paper

This repository provides the official implementation of AI-based_GN_Diagnostic_Assistance_Toolã€‚


**Improving Diagnostic Efficiency in Glomerular Nephritis through an Integrated AI-based Pathological Image Analysis Approach** (*Under Review*)


### Key Features
An AI-based GN diagnostic assistance tool is developed and the diagnostic pipeline comprises three sequential steps: glomerulus segmentation, glomerulus lesion feature extraction and patient-level diagnosis.

The tool consists of three core components: 

(1) a glomerular localization module for precise glomerulus segmentation;       

(2) two multi-classification module for identifying glomerular lesions; 

(3) a patient-level classification module for diagnosing four GN subtypes.




## âœ¨Installation & Preliminary
1. Clone the repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Git-HB-CHEN/AI-based_GN_Diagnostic_Assistance_Tool.git
